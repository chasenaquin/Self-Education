      <ul>
        <li>It is impossible to manage a service correctly, let alone well, without understanding which behaviors really matter for that service and how to measure and evaluate those behaviors.</li>
        <li>We use intuition, experience, and understanding of what users want to define Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Objectives (SLOs), and Agreements (SLAs).</li>
        <li>These measurements describe the basic properties of metrics that matter, what values we want those metrics to have, and how we will react if we can’t provide the expected service. </li>
        <li>Metric Modeling, Metric Selection, and Metric Analysis</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Service Level Terminology</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Indicators</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A carefully defined quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Request latency (How long it takes to return a response to a request)</li>
            <li>Error rate (a fraction of all requests received)</li>
            <li>System Throughput (requests per second)</li>
            <li>Availability (fraction of the time that the service is usable) (Yield)</li>
            <li>Durability (The likelihood that data will be retained over a long period of time</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Ideally, the SLI directly measures a service level of interest, but sometimes only a proxy is available</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Objectives</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI. </li>
          <li>SLI <= Target or Lower Bound <= SLI <= Upper Bound.</li>
          <li>Higher QPS often leads to larger latency, and its common for services to have a performance cliff beyond some load threshold. </li>
          <li>Publishing the SLOs to users set correct expectations. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Agreements</li>
        <ul>
          <li>An explicit or implicit contract with your users that includes the consequences of meeting (or missing) the SLO they contain.  (What happens if the SLO's are not met?)</li>
          <li>Most recognizable when they are financial (rebate / penalty). </li>
          <li>SRE not typically involved in making SLA's (closely tied to business and product decisions)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Global Chubby Planned Outage</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A controlled outage synthesized by intentionally taking down the system resulted in flushing out unreasonable dependencies on the service. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Indicators in Practice</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>What do you and your users care about?</li>
          <li>Chose a handful of representative indicators that show system health.</li>
          <li>Services tend to fall into a few braod categories in terms of the SLIs they find relevant:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>User-facing systems</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Availability (Could we respond to the request)</li>
              <li>Latency (How long did it take to respond)</li>
              <li>Throughput (How many requests could be handled)</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
