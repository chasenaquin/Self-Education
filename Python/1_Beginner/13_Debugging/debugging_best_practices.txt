# # Describe Problem
# def my_function():
#   for i in range(1, 20):
#     if i == 20:
#       print("You got it")
# my_function()
# # Range does not include the value of the last argument. (Upper bound)
# # needs to be ffor i in range(1, 21):

# # Reproduce the Bug
# from random import randint
# dice_imgs = ["❶", "❷", "❸", "❹", "❺", "❻"]
# dice_num = randint(1, 6)
# print(dice_imgs[dice_num])
# # Base starting point for lists is 0. This will never select position 0 ("❶")
# # position 6 will break index looking for the position after "❻"
# # would have to change dice_num = randint(0,5)
# # IndexError: list index out of range

# # Play Computer
# year = int(input("What's your year of birth? "))
# if year > 1980 and year < 1994:
#   print("You are a millenial.")
# elif year > 1994:
#   print("You are a Gen Z.")
#  # Does not address the actual input of 1994. Needs to be
#  # if year > 1980 and year <= 1994

# # Fix the Errors
# age = input("How old are you?")
# if age > 18:
# print(f"You can drive at age {age}.")
# Needs to be an int. Cant operate on diff data types.
# needs to be F-String :  print(f"You can drive at age {age}.")

# #Print is Your Friend
# pages = 0
# word_per_page = 0
# pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
# word_per_page == int(input("Number of words per page: "))
# total_words = pages * word_per_page
# print(total_words)
# = and == are different.
# Change: word_per_page = int(input("Number of words per page: "))

# #Use a Debugger
# def mutate(a_list):
#   b_list = []
#   for item in a_list:
#     new_item = item * 2
#   b_list.append(new_item)
#   print(b_list)
#
# mutate([1,2,3,5,8,13])
# # the line: b_list.append(new_item) is not in the for loop, thus overwritting the
# # b_list to the last value of a_list *2. Indent this line into the for loop.
